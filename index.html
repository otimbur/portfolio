            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Olga Timbur. My passion for work comes from the desire for knowledge and the struggle my
                parents had to provide for me. Originally from Moldova,
                I had to emigrate when I was 20 years old for a better future like many of my people.
                I am happy to affirm that this experience taught me a lot about life and motivation
                In my work experience, I learned that I could achieve skills through hard work.
                Banking was one field I knew nothing about, but training and work made me gain skills
                such as customer service, sales, and teamwork skills. Following the line, I soon transitioned to the
                medical field, where multitasking, critical thinking, and productivity were significant components.
                This new experience made me realize that I can have a job in the tech field if I work hard. For many
                years,
                this was my goal, but my insecurities had to be destroyed.
                I am glad to say that today I am an emerging professional in the Application Development
                track in a program called YearUp and what are you reading right now is part my traning to gain
                skills in the HTML and CSS and JavaScript
